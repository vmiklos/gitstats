= Simple statistics generator for git
Miklos Vajna <vmiklos@frugalware.org>

== Status

This project was originally a port of my
http://ftp.frugalware.org/pub/other/darcsstats/[darcsstats] project to git. It
worth to mention that it was originally inspired by Juli Mallett's
http://people.FreeBSD.org/~jmallett/cvstat-5.0.tgz[cvstat].

It supports all the features which are provided by `cvstat`, plus a number of
extras. See the 'What works' section for a list of them.

If you want something more complex, then try out
http://tree.celinuxforum.org/gitstat/[gitstat]. It is a mix of php and perl,
requires mysql, etc. Obviously it has more features, but you may say that it's
bloated. Then `gitstats` is for you.

== How to set it up

You need to have a copy of `config.py` in the current dir. Probably you want to
have a config for each project to set the aliases and ignores. Here is the
format of ignores:

----
	ignore = ['A B <foo@server.com>', 'C D <bar@server.com>']
----

If you know Python, this will be familiar to you.

The aliases directive is a Python dictionary:

----
	aliases = {
			'X Y <old@server.com>': 'X Y <new@server.com>'
			}
----

== Running it

Then all you need is to run `gitstats`:

----
$ python /path/to/gitstats.py ~/git/myrepo.git output.html
----

== What works

- Features supported by `cvstat`.

- Ignore support. This is handy when you import a cvs project to git and there
  were an `anonymous` user in cvs.

- Alias support, so that your stats are not lost when you change your mail
  address.

== What needs to be done (aka. TODO)

- Sort the table by '# of Changes'

== I would like to have support for ...

If something does not work and it's not in the TODO section, then please
contact me!

In fact, of course, I wrote this documentation after figured out how to do this
setup, so maybe I left out some steps. If you needed 'any' additional tricks,
then it would be nice to include them here.

== Known bugs

- None at this time.
